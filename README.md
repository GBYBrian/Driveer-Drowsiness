# Driver-Drowsiness-detection-using-Mediapipe

Driving for extended periods can be tiresome and lead to drowsiness, increasing the risk of nodding off. To tackle this issue, we'll develop a drowsy driver detection system using Python, leveraging Mediapipe's Face Mesh solution and the Eye Aspect Ratio formula. Our objective is to build a reliable application that can detect when a driver's eyes remain closed for an extended duration, providing timely alerts to prevent potential accidents.

Leveraging the power of MediaPipe, I have developed a sophisticated system that 
accurately identifies signs of drowsiness in drivers in real-time.



The heart of this project lies in the implementation of MediaPipe, a powerful open-source library. 
Through its robust features, I was able to efficiently process and analyze facial expressions, 
eye movements, allowing for accurate detection of drowsiness patterns.



Human errors, often due to drowsiness or distractions, contribute significantly to road accidents.
By providing automated alerts, the project minimizes the chances of human error caused by impaired attention or reaction times.
